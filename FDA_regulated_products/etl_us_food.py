The openFDA food enforcement reports API returns data from the FDA Recall Enterprise System (RES),
a database that contains information on recall event information submitted to FDA.
Currently, this data covers publicly releasable records from 2004-present. The data is updated weekly.
The procedures followed to input recall information into RES when FDA learns of a recall event
are outlined in Chapter 7 of FDAâ€™s Regulatory Procedure Manual The Regulatory Procedures Manual is a reference manual for FDA personnel.
It provides FDA personnel with information on internal procedures to be used in processing domestic and import regulatory and enforcement matters.
